                    <h1 style="font-size: 1.4em;color: black;">The Lead-Generation or Sales Webinar</h1>
                    <p class="lead" align="justify">
                        This is the most common type of “webinar” that is offered today. This is where you get someone to register for your webinar in exchange for them providing you with their email address and other relevant information.You get a new contact on your list and a chance to sell a product or service, the prospective consumer gets free content.

                        If you’re using this type of webinar and want to develop a good reputation, make sure that you provide content and value that can stand independent of your product or service. Focus on providing value and building a relationship so that you become the first point of contact for anyone seeking a solution in your arena.<br/>

                        For example, I have a client who sells life insurance. When I asked her if she had thought about using a webinar as a way to generate leads she all-but-laughed at me.

                        Sure enough, she targeted solopreneurs and entrepreneurs with one to 10 employees, ran an educational lead-generation webinar, and got a higher rate of conversation from lead to client than from other networking avenues.<br/>

                        There’s a big gap between information and knowledge. Find a way to educate your potential consumer, position yourself as the expert resource, and watch your business grow. </p>

                    <h1 style="font-size: 1.4em;color: black;">The One-Off For-Profit Webinar</h1>
                    <p class="lead" align="justify">This is a webinar that you charge for. It’s on a single topic, with a specific learning objective, a unique benefit, and a promise of value. This is not the webinar where you want to market or sell additional services. Focus on providing so much bang-for-the-buck that the customer comes to you for more.

                        It depends on your audience and your topic. Even with a market saturated with “free” content, people pay for value. Focus on providing it. Think about depth in one area instead of breadth over many.<br/>

                        If you’re going to do a one-off webinar, I suggest having accompanying materials, such as handouts or worksheets, that participants can use to follow-along, take notes, or supplement their learning. It’s also a wise practice to leave some room for Q&A at the end. People paid for access to you, so spend a little extra time catering to your audience. </p>

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">If you’re a trainer, you can use these webinars to convert your face-to-face content to a virtual format that you can sell at the same price point. If you’re an author, you can expand your book into a training program that goes beyond the page. If your company offers a product that is used to help consumers generate income, specialized training webinars can be a great solution—whether your not you choose to sell them for profit. Think about a certification or continuing education units.<br/><br/>

                        The possibilities here are endless, and the repackaging opportunities abundant. Keep in mind the importance of well-defined learning objectives, the continuity of material, and making sure each module or part of the series provides value that can stand on its own, but also builds to something greater throughout the course.<br/><br/>

                        No matter which type of webinar you chose,remember the two key ingredients:<br/>
                        •	<b>Training</b><br/>
                        •	<b>Interaction</b><br/><br/>

                        A well-executed webinar takes work, but it’s worth it.</p>
                    <!--<p class="lead" align="justify">If you offer your webinar as a training session, you'll be teaching them skills. It might be about an hour long, with a handout they download in advance, and exercises they complete during the session. You'll still do most of the talking, but you might have more than one opportunity for them to ask you questions, and you'll allow more time for questions. </p>
                    <p class="lead" align="justify">With the ability to share your screen with panellists you can hold workshops as your webinar, taking through viewers step-by-step what to do. Either by showing them PowerPoint presentations or your own screen through screen share, you give the audience the ability to follow something on-screen without the human elemnt lost as you will still be on camera.</p>-->

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">
                        There are many ways you can establish yourself and get your name out there for instance: social media, guest blogging, and public relations. These are all excellent ways to promote yourself, however, webinars help you establish credibility quickly because a) not everyone is doing them and b) when you present on a specific topic you become the go-to person<br/>

                        When you conduct webinars, people get to hear from you in a different way than the written format that is blogging, which also helps build trust. With webinars you have the opportunity to strengthen relationships with your audience. For example, when you present in webinar format, your audience can show up live and ask you questions and you can engage with them. </p>

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">
                        Hosting a webinar is a way to get in front of your audience and educate them about what you do. For example, if you are a health coach you could do a webinar on 10 ways to detox in spring. Similarly, if you are a website designer, you may decide to present on the 6 website tweaks to get more traffic. Or if you are a copywriter, you may decide to present on the 3 Steps To Writing A Killer Sales Page That Converts.<br/>

                        Your webinar should focus on educating- the audience should walk away with something tangible. Remember it’s not an infomercial! </p>

                        Another amazing benefit of Webinars
                        You get to promote and broaden your reach on your own terms. You don’t have to wait for a guest post to be accepted and you get to dictate how often and when you want to do them.<br/>
                        As an example, if you are planning a new product or service launch, you may decide that you want to do a webinar every week or every month.
                        I run my webinars using Google Hangouts with slides but I could easily make them informal and just go live with my webcam and connect with my audience that way.

                        When I promote my webinars, I announce it to my mailing list and I also reach out to whole new audiences through sharing on social media, joint venture partners or Facebook ads.
                        I use Facebook ads quite a lot as they allow me to reach new people, very targeted and similar to my ideal client avatar.<br/>
                        You could create one webinar and simply reposition who you are targeting that webinar to and offer it regularly as part of your marketing strategy.

                        Another advantage of doing a webinar is getting to know your audience. Because people are opt-ing in for a particular topic, it allows you to gauge the interest level of that topic. Webinars are an excellent way to have two-way communication with your audience as they are showing up live and you can engage with them with polls and live Q&A.</p>

                        In the last three months, I have added 800 new people to my list by sharing my webinar in specific Google+ communities, Facebook groups, and Facebook ads. I haven’t seen this kind of growth doing any other marketing activity. Webinars allow you to grow your list and potential leads in a very big way- not like a trickle which you may see through other forms like social media and blogging.</p><br/>
                    <p class="lead" align="justify">That’s why I’m excited about webinars because I know that by growing my list and building relationships with my ideal clients, I can learn how to better serve them. Additionally, it’s another opportunity to segment your list.</p><br/>
                    <p class="lead" align="justify"> When I conduct a webinar, people get added to my webinar list as well as my main newsletter list. Then, if I have a specific offer related to that topic, I can reach out to the webinar list and follow up with an offer.
                        To recap, through webinars you can establish credibility, broaden your reach, get to know your audience, have a reason to follow up, and can customize and segment your offers
