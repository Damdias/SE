                    <p class="lead" align="justify">
                        Blended learning is a term increasingly used to describe the way e-learning is being combined with traditional classroom methods and independent study to create a new, hybrid teaching methodology. It represents a much greater change in basic technique than simply adding computers to classrooms; it represents, in many cases, a fundamental change in the way teachers and students approach the learning experience. It has already produced an offshoot – the flipped classroom – that has quickly become a distinct approach of its own.</p>
                    <p class="lead" align="justify">No single, reliable definitions of blended learning exist, or even a universal agreement on the term itself. Many use terms like hybrid, mixed, or integrative to describe the same trend. But the trend is significant. In 2000 an estimated 45,000 K-12 students took an online course, but almost a decade later more than 3 million took courses that way, many of them using computers in the schools themselves.</p>

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">Technology-based training emerged as an alternative to instructor-led training in the 1960s on mainframes and mini-computers. The major advantage that blended learning offers is scale, whereas one instructor can only teach so many people. One example is PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations), a system developed by the University of Illinois and Control Data. PLATO in particular had a long history of innovations and offered coursework from elementary to the college level. Mainframe-based training had a number of interface limitations that gave way to satellite-based live video in the 1970s. The advantage here was serving people who were not as computer literate. The major challenge was the expense required to make this work. In the early 1990s, CD-ROMs emerged as a dominant form of providing technology-based learning as bandwidth through 56k modems weren’t able to support very high quality sound and video. The limitation to CD-ROMs was tracking completion of coursework, so learning management systems emerged as a way to facilitate progress tracking. The aviation industry used this heavily to track how well one did on courses, how much time was spent, and where someone left off. AICC, Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee, was formed in 1988 and companies such as Boeing used CD-ROMs to provide training for personnel. Modern blended learning is delivered online, although CD-ROMs could feasibly still be used if a learning management system meets an institution's standards. Some examples of channels through which online blending learning can be delivered include webcasting (synchronous and asynchronous) and online video (live and recorded). Solutions such as Khan Academy have been used in classrooms to serve as platforms for blended learning.</p>

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">Although there is little consensus on the definition of blended learning and some academic studies have suggested it is a redundant term, there are distinct blended learning models that have been suggested by some researchers and educational think tanks.</p>
                    <P class="lead" align="justify">Blended learning can generally be classified into six models:</P>
                    <P>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Face-to-face driver – where the teacher drives the instruction and augments with digital tools.</li>
                            <li>Rotation – students cycle through a schedule of independent online study and face-to-face classroom time.</li>
                            <li>Flex – Most of the curriculum is delivered via a digital platform and teachers are available for face-to-face consultation and support.</li>
                            <li>Labs – All of the curriculum is delivered via a digital platform but in a consistent physical location. Students usually take traditional classes in this model as well.</li>
                            <li>Self-blend – Students choose to augment their traditional learning with online course work.</li>
                            <li>Online driver – Students complete an entire course through an online platform with possible teacher check-ins. All curriculum and teaching is delivered via a digital platform and face-to-face meetings are scheduled or made available if necessary.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">A blended learning approach ensures that the learner is engaged and driving his/her individual learning experience. In addition, since difference students have unique learning styles, a blended approach is more likely to cater to those needs. We’ve listed out a few pros and cons for you.</p>
                    <P><b>Advantages</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collaborative learning experiences: - Collaboration between the students and instructor can increase substantially via an online training platform. With many collaborative tools (online discussions, blogs, instant messages, etc.) the students are able to connect with each other in or out of the classroom.</li>
                        <li>Increased accessibility: - Improves access as well as student attitudes towards learning. The students are given the tools to access the course materials anytime, anywhere.</li>
                        <li>Better communication: - Communication is improved between lecturers and part-time/full-time students. An online training platform can provide many communication tools such as news announcements, e-mail, instant messaging, online discussions, online grading tool, dropboxes, and more.</li>
                        <li>Successful evaluations: - Better student evaluations via the use of online testing and assessments with reporting features. Often times, the students can evaluate themselves better as well with immediate grading or feedback.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </P>
                    <p><b>Disadvantages</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strong technological dependence:- The tech resources and tools need to be reliable, easy to use, and up to date in order for the use of the Internet to have a meaningful impact on the learning experience.</li>
                            <li>Lack of IT knowledge:- IT literacy can serve as a significant barrier for students attempting to get access to the course materials. The availability of technical support is a must.</li>
                            <li>Students can fall behind:- The use of lecture recording technologies can result in students falling behind on the material. Nearly half of all students will wait and watch several weeks’ worth of videos in one sitting, rather than on a regular basis.</li>
                        </ul>
